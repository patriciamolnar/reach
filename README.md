Thank you for checking out my solution. I have completed both options.

# Option 1

Apart from coding the requirements of the brief, I have also: 
* Added ARIA Labels to the "Show More" button and the hidden paragraphs for accessibility
* Added a navigation menu that appears when the burger is clicked 
* Manually created the logo with only CSS
* Created the "OFFER" tag over one of the images with only CSS
* Added hover and focus rules

I am using the JavaScript Intersection Observer API to lazy load the images when they enter the viewport.

# Option 2 

For exercise 03-api-call the links returned by https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/ are prefixed with `https`. The snapshot however has these links saved with `http`. If I change them to `https` the tests pass. (I have left the snapshot unaltered though, so my current solution does not pass the test).
